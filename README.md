# Drag and Drop Canvas

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates drag and drop functionality on a canvas. It allows users to drag and drop objects within the canvas, resize the objects, and log their positions and sizes.

## Features

### Drag and Drop

You can drag the object within the canvas by clicking on it and dragging it to a new position. The object will follow your cursor as you move it.

### Logging Position and Size

Click the "Log" button located outside the canvas to log the current position and size of the object. The logged information will be displayed in the console.
